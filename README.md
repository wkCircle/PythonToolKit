# PythonToolKit

## Motivation 
This Repo should help save time for data scientists' daily work regarding the Time Series regression task by providing functions/classes about data preprocessing, feature engineering, plotting, and some time series statistical tests.

## Prospect
This Repo stores useful Preprocessing, FE, Plotting, and Testing functions written in Python. Currently most functions are designed for the concern of Time Series prediction. In the future, I hope to expand the task categories to not just TS but also NLP, be it generative learning or accuracy learning, or be it regression task or classification task. 

## How to Contribute

1. git clone this project 
2. create the branch with the branch name either based on the issues/tickets or based on the your git id name. 
3. go to that branch, fix the bug or implement new functionalities, upload to remote branch, then pull requests to main by assigning the me(Kai) as the approver. 
4. check the messages in the pull request regularly when it is still ongoin(open). After approved, close the branch that is no longer used.

Please help improve the Repo by providing new funtions or making existing functions more stable. Let's improve the tools and boost up our insight in data science tasks!
